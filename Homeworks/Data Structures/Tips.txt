Locality of reference (how data is stored, localized in the memory)
Cuckoo hashing algorithm (interesting & efficient one)

Trees:
*Binary Search Trees:
	AVL Tree vs RedBlack Tree
	*AVL
		-> strictly balanced -> faster look-up O(logN)
		-> slower add/remove because of the strict balance rules
	*RedBlack
		-> less strictly balanced -> slower look-up O(logN)
		-> faster add/remove because of the less strinct balance rules
	===> AVL -> more appropriate when we don't frequenty add/remove nodes but we expect to look-up frequently.
	===> RedBlack -> more appropriate when we frequently add/remove nodes and don't look-up too much (because of the slower look-up performance compared to AVL)

*B-Tree -> appropriate when we work with HDD database because it can hold nodes containing a lot of keys so they can fit in a single block in the HDD which helps improve performance when avoiding reading multiple blocks (reading from the HDD is way way slower than reading from the memory (1000x+ slower))

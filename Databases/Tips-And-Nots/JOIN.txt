TODO: learn about usage of JOIN and WHERE - how do they work, is WHERE lazy, which way is more efficient, does it have any difference?

INNER:
	-> gets all elements which match given condition
	
	SELECT e.LastName, d.Name AS DepartmentName
	From Employees e
		INNER JOIN Departments d
			ON e.DepartmentID = d.DepartmentID
			
	*another way to do it:
	SELECT e.LastName, d.Name AS DepartmentName
	From Employees e, Departments d
	WHERE e.DepartmentID = d.DepartmentID

	SELECT e.LastName, m.EmployeeID AS MgrID, m.LastName AS MgrLastName
	FROM Employees e
		INNER JOIN Employees m
			ON e.ManagerID = m.EmployeeID

			
	SELECT e.FirstName, t.Name as Towns, a.AdressText as Address
	From Employees e
		JOIN Adresses a
			ON e.AdressID = a.AdressID
		JOIN Towns t
			ON a.TownID = t.TownID
			
LEFT:
	-> gets all the elements from the column we make JOIN on (first one), which don't match the condition and after them all elements which match it.
	
	SELECT 
		e.LastName AS EmpLastName, 
		m.EmployeeID AS MgrID, 
		m.LastName AS Mgr LastName
	FROM Employees e 
		LEFT OUTER JOIN Employees m
			ON e.ManagerID = m.EmployeeID
	
RIGHT:
	-> gets all the elements from the column we JOIN (second one), which don't match the condition and after them all elements which match it.
	
		SELECT 
		e.LastName AS EmpLastName, 
		m.EmployeeID AS MgrID, 
		m.LastName AS Mgr LastName
	FROM Employees e 
		RIGHT OUTER JOIN Employees m
			ON e.ManagerID = m.EmployeeID
	-> getting all employees who don't manage anybody.
FULL OUTER:
	-> gets all elements from inner join as well as the result of a left and right join

FROM Employees e
INNER JOIN Departments d
	ON (e.DepartmentID = d.DepartmentID)
	AND e.HireDate > '1/1/1999'
	AND d.Name IN ('Sales', 'Finance')

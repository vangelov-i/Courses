BETWEEN -> bool for ranges (inclusive) - a <= c && a >= d
IN -> checks if something is among given values
	WHERE ManagerID IN (109, 3, 16) -> gets all results which have one of these IDs
NOT IN -> ... the oposite

LIKE -> pattern for string search
	WHERE FirstName LIKE 'S%' -> every element which starts with S and has 0 or more symbols afterwards ('%S' - elements ending with 'S')

When making comparisson with null -> 	WHERE ManagerID IS NULL 
										WHERE ManagerID IS NOT NULL
								WRONG: WHERE ManagerID = NULL

Logical checks with: AND, OR, NOT

	SELECT FirstName
	FROM Employees
	WHERE Salary >= 20000 AND LastName Like 'C%'

	-==-...
	WHERE NOT (ManagerID = 3 OR ManagerID = 4) ... Can't it be with NOT IN?


	SELECT FirstName AS Name, Salary + 300 AS SalaryWithBonus
	From Employees
	WHERE ManagerID IS NOT NULL
	ORDER BY Name, SalaryWithBonus
	-> we can use named columns in the query after it's declaration

	-> good explanation of schema
	
Proccessing models:

DOM (Document Object Model):
	*uses the memory. Easier to use but not appropriate for big XML files
	*has LINQ
	
	*use when proccessing XMLs less than 10MB
	*use when there's a need of flexability
	*use when you need to modify the XML document
SAX:
	*Event based stream reading of the XML
	*Appropriate for proccessing big XML documents
StAX:
	*Read is invoked synchronously by the developer
	*when processing XMLs less than 1MB
*use SAX/StAX for proccessing big documents
*use when we need performance
*use when there is no need to change the document

XPath (XML Path Language)
	-> a language for addresing parts of XML document
	-> XPath expressions contain description of paths to nodes and filter  criteria
	-> check the syntax from presentation
/library/book[isbn='dasdfa'] => find the book in library with that isbn
/book/chapter[3]/paragraph[last()]

XSL transformations(XSLT)
	-> allows to transform one XML doc to other XML doc with diff structure
	-> convert between different XML formats
	-> XSLT depends on XPath for matching parts from one doc and replacing them with another XML
	-> XSLT can be used to transform XML doc to XHTML
